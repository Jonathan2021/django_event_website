Image seems to take time to load in event

footer isnt all the way to the bottom

clicking on EPITA's logo should redirect to EPITA's website

BUY now in event should redirect to tickets for the event, not list of available event tickets

each time I create an object, call full_clean()

Why use scroll down intern-extern when buying?

Deleting an event doesnt remove it from shop

Slide montre toujours 3 évenements alors que ca devrait etre tous, et si il y en a qu un, tu peux toujours glisser sur 3 (ce qui ne devrait pas être le cas)

See if Hide can be hacked for forms

members in memberform should only be from epita should only be epita's

 Maybe should do it the other way around, old_values become the modified ones and thoses saved in the database or the old_ones

 Users cant see event detail if it is not approved even with correct url

 Should put restriction on post AssoDetailView

 use bulk_create instead of for loop

 Maybe create prices automatically when creating event ?

Image seems to take time to load in event

footer isnt all the way to the bottom

clicking on EPITA's logo should redirect to EPITA's website

Instead of created by, show the association hosting the event

BUY now in event should redirect to tickets for the event, not list of available event tickets

each time I create an object, call full_clean()

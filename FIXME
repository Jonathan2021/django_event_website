Image seems to take time to load in event

footer isnt all the way to the bottom

clicking on EPITA's logo should redirect to EPITA's website

Instead of created by, show the association hosting the event

BUY now in event should redirect to tickets for the event, not list of available event tickets

each time I create an object, call full_clean()

Shouldn't be called premium event in index, more like 'Fresh events etc.' premium is just for us to know

Why use sscroll down intern-extern when buying?

Deleting an event doesnt remove it from shop

UPGARDING TO MEMBRE DE BUREAU FAIL!

Maybe instead of testing if user.memberships is empty or not etc. make a query to get all assos where user has create_event perms

When clicking in input field in forms, it shouldn't be red

Should you really allow None image in event model?

Slide montre toujours 3 évenements alors que ca devrait etre tous, et si il y en a qu un, tu peux toujours glisser sur 3 (ce qui ne devrait pas être le cas)

Change __str__ to __unicode__

Should pipenv install address and add it to installed app instead of having source code in it

Repetition in perms (assos_detail), maybe store result in var

write get_absolute_url for models

.all().first() should be replaced by .first()

See if Hide can be hacked for forms
